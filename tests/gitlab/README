In this directory we gather utility scripts related to Gitlab testing.

* `build_and_test` is used in CI to build TPLs (dependencies) and MFEM and to test it.

While designed to be used in CI context, this script can also be used standalone on LC in order to reproduce a similar build. The script uses environment variables for configuration (a place for improvement), such as "BUILD_ROOT", "HOST_CONFIG", "SPEC", etc. Some are mandatory, while others have default values.

* `get_mfem_uberenv` sets uberenv up for use with MFEM, notably to install TPLs with spack.

Uberenv, configured for MFEM, is maintained in a separate repo. This script downloads and places it in `tests/uberenv`. The exact commit to extract is hard-coded.

* `generate_spack_upstream` can be used to generate a spack upstream instance.

`generate_spack_upstream` addresses a much less common use case, where the TPLs for any MFEM target appearing in CI are built in a spack instance using Uberenv. Configuring permissions accordingly allows this instance to be reused to prevent multiple installations. Such an upstream instance can be found on LC in `/usr/workspace/mfem/spack-upstream`.
