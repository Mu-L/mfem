To correct this error, make sure that the .gitignore file is properly updated.

Generally, this file should contain exactly the files that can be generated from
the repository (via building + running) that we *do not* want in the repository.
(This way such files cannot be accidentally committed.)

In particular, make sure that:

1) All new executables and outputs from example/miniapp runs (e.g. mesh or
   solution files), are listed in .gitignore.
2) The patterns listed in .gitignore are the same as the ones that are deleted
   by 'make distclean'.
3) Nothing else is excluded from .gitignore.

Please contact a member of the MFEM team if you have questions.
