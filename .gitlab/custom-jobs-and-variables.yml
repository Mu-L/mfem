# The path to the shared resource between all jobs in the 'ruby-baseline'
# pipeline. For example, external repositories like 'tests' and 'tpls' are
# cloned here. Also, 'tpls' is built once for all targets, so that build happens
# here. The BUILD_ROOT is unique to the pipeline, preventing any form of
# concurrency with other pipelines. This directory is removed by the 'cleanup'
# stage in the 'ruby-baseline' pipeline.

# On LLNL's ruby and tioga, the 'build-and-test' pipelines creates only one
